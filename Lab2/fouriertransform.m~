% Function to take the fourier transform of an image x
function [out, average] = fouriertransform(x)
    % Convert it to doubles 
    y = im2double(x);
    
    % Determine size input image
    [ M, N ] = size(x);
    
    % Calculate the 2D Fourier transform
    fft_image = fft2(y);
    
    % Center it 
    fft_shift = fftshift(fft_image);
    
    % Calculate average, by taking the first component and normalizing this
    % by using the size of the images
    average = fft_image(1,1)/(M*N);
   
    % Calculating the Fourier Spectrum by taking the absolute value, i.e. 
    % (real_part^2 + imag_part^2)^(1/2)
    out = mat2gray( (real(fft_shift) );
